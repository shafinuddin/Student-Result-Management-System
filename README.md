Student Result Management System
📌 Project Description

The Student Result Management System is a Python-based program designed to calculate and manage student results efficiently.
It takes subject marks as input, calculates the total and average, and assigns a grade based on predefined conditions.

This project is suitable for students learning Python, especially concepts like loops, lists, strings, and conditional statements.

🎯 Objectives

To understand the use of loops and lists

To apply conditional logic (if–elif–else)

To perform basic calculations

To build a real-life academic result system

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Concepts Applied:

Input & Output

Lists

Loops (for)

Conditional Statements

Arithmetic Operations

String Formatting

⚙️ How the System Works

The user enters the number of subjects.

Marks for each subject are taken as input.

The system stores marks in a list.

Total and average marks are calculated.

A grade is assigned based on the average.

Final result is displayed in a formatted output.

📊 Grading Criteria
Average Marks	Grade
90 and above	A+
80 – 89	A
70 – 79	B
60 – 69	C
50 – 59	D
Below 50	F
